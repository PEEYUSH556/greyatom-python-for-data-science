### Project Overview

 This project is about how we can manage the student academic details. This project is totally based upon the Data Wrangling [means on the basics of python] like dictionaries, Lists, if-else, string, etc. 


### Learnings from the project

 There are many good lessons I learned, but probably the most important is that to learn the basics of python language and its libraries first.
